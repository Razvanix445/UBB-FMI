Identifiers
An identifier is an arbitrarily long sequence of digits (0-9), underscores (_), lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z)
Latin letters, and most Unicode characters.

The first character of a valid identifier must be one of the following:

- uppercase Latin letters A-Z
- lowercase Latin letters a-z
- underscore
- any Unicode character with the Unicode property XID_Start

Any other character of a valid identifier must be one of the following:

- digits 0-9
- uppercase Latin letters A-Z
- lowercase Latin letters a-z
- underscore
- any Unicode character with the Unicode property XID_Continue

The lists of characters with properties XID_Start and XID_Continue can be found in DerivedCoreProperties.txt.

Identifiers are case-sensitive (lowercase and uppercase letters are distinct), and every character is significant.
Every identifier must conform to Normalization Form C.
